# üöö Fast Feet API
I developed this project as a challenge about my latest studies of Node at [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br).

## üöÄ Techs and Tools
- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) / [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)  / [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/) + [AWS SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3)
- [Redis](https://redis.io) + [ioredis](https://github.com/redis/ioredis)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## üñ•Ô∏è Project
*Soon*

<summary>Display contents</summary>
	
```shell
npm i
docker compose up -d
npx prisma migrate dev # seeds will run along
npx prisma studio
```
</details>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate JWT keys:
<details>
<summary>Display contents</summary>
	
```shell
# Generate RSA256 secret and public keys: (Requires OpenSSL installed)
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem

# Convert keys to Base64: (MacOS/Linux)
base64 -i private_key.pem -o private_key.txt
base64 -i public_key.pem -o public_key.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Cloudflare R2 services:
<details>
<summary>Display contents</summary>
	
It's need to create two Cloudflare R2 buckets, one for development and another for tests.
</details>

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set enviroment variables:
<details>
<summary>Display contents</summary>
	
Generate .env files for development and test. Then, set them up with Postgres database, Redis cache, JWT tokens and Cloudflare keys:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.test.example .env.test
```
</details>

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run tests and start application:
<details>
<summary>Display contents</summary>
	
```shell
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
npm run start:dev
```
</details>
